## How it works:

- The instructor/presenter prepares these slides for audience feedback. There could be multiple of them. 
- The presenter shares the polls one at a time, when time is right.
- The audience has to follow the instruction given at the top of the presentation-slide and provide their feedback to the poll.
- The instructor and the audience then gets to see the live feedback update on the shared presentation together.
- The **presenter needs a `mentee.com` account** :point_right: **sign-up is necessary**.
- The **audience does not need to sign up** to provide feedback. Each presentation comes with a code 
  (typically active for 48 hours), that the audience can use on `www.mentee.com` and provide their 
  feedback to the specific poll.
