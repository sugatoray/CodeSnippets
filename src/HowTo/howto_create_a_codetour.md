# Creating Code Tour Videos/Gifs

- Record a video using OBS Studio and your favorite code editor.
- Use [CodeTour VSCode Extension][#codetour-vscode-ext]: `vsls-contrib.codetour`

  > **CodeTour is a Visual Studio Code extension, which allows you to record and playback guided walkthroughs 
  > of your codebases**. 
  > 
  > It's like a virtual brownbag, or table of contents, that can make it easier to onboard 
  > (or re-board!) to a new project/feature area, visualize bug reports, or understand the context of a code 
  > review/PR change. A "code tour" is simply a series of interactive steps, each of which are associated with 
  > a specific directory, or file/line, and include a description of the respective code. This allows developers 
  > to clone a repo, and then immediately start learning it, without needing to refer to a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file 
  > and/or rely on help from others. Tours can either be checked into a repo, to enable sharing with other 
  > contributors, or exported to a `"tour file"`, which allows anyone to replay the same tour, without having to 
  > clone any code to do it!
