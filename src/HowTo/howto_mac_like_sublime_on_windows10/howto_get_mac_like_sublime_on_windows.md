## Steps:

1. Download and install **`SublimeText`**.
1. Download the latest stabel release of **`SublimeText-Overlay`** from here: 
	- Source: https://github.com/avarayr/SublimeText-Overlay/releases
	- Download the `zip` file. Unzip it and you will find a `.exe` file:

1. Keep the executable file (`SublimeOverlay.exe`) saved for later use.
1. Now open SublimeText.
1. Run the executable (SublimeOverlay.exe).
   
   > This will emulate Mac-like look on Sublime.
1. For best look-and-feel, go to `View` > `Hide Tabs` and `Hide Menu`. 
1. To later access the menubar, just press <kbd>Alt</kbd>.
