# How to access a `Makefile` from a subdirectory of your project

The following is a modification of the Makefile used in 
[`PyTorchLightning/lightning-bolts`][#gh-repo-lightning_bolts] repo on GitHub.
I use this Makefile for running various commands in 
[`omry/omegaconf`][#gh-repo-omegaconf] project on GitHub. 

[#gh-repo-lightning_bolts]: https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning-bolts
[#gh-repo-omegaconf]: https://github.com/omry/omegaconf/

> *Disclaimer*: Some of the commands may not work, however, overall it seems to work.

## The use-case

The `omegaconf` repository does not contain any Makefile of it's own. So, to use a Makefile 
just for myself, and not having to add an entry to ignore this Makefile in the `.gitignore` file, 
I placed the Makefile in the `.vscode` directory (since *.vscode* is already added to *.gitignore* file).
However, this meant that I will not be able to run the commands as `make [COMMAND]` from the 
project root directory (`omegaconf`). 

So, I looked up on Stackoverflow and found this answer: [How to run make file from any directory?][#soq]

[#soq]: https://superuser.com/questions/370575/how-to-run-make-file-from-any-directory/1258431

In a nutshell, the best answer there suggested either of the methods would work (but it did not fit my usecase).

```bash
# method-1
(cd /other/dir && make)

# method-2
make -C /other/dir
```

What I was looking for is: create a Makefile to run from the project root directory, but then move 
it into the .vscode subdirectory; and finally run the make commands from the project root directory. 
And the solution requires you to specify the location of the Makefile, while running the command 
from the project root direcyory.

```bash
make -f ./.vscode/Makefile [COMMAND]
```

Now in order to make life easier, I added another alias (`xmake`), such that I could simply replace the `make` 
command while running it from the project-root.

```bash
alias xmake="make -f ./.vscode/Makefile"
```

And now I can just do this:

```bash
# this will run the docs COMMAND from the Makefile
xmake docs
```

## Example Makefile

```makefile
.PHONY: test clean testcov docs env

# assume you have installed need packages
export SPHINX_MOCK_REQUIREMENTS=1

# We keep this makefile inside .vscode
# To run this file from the root of the project
# use: make -f ./.vscode/Makefile [COMMAND]
# For convenience, create an alias:
# $ alias xmake="make -f ./.vscode/Makefile"
# And then use xmake instead of make from the
# project-root.

	@echo "\n🗑️ Cleaning up... ⏳\n"
	# clean all temp runs

## Setting up dev-env

In addition to the above script I have another shell script for setting up the environment 
for a given open-source project (which does not share any `environment.yml` file out of the box).

For example, the [`omry/omegaconf`][#gh-repo-omegaconf] repository does not have any 
`environment.yml` file shared. But I prefer to have a dedicated miniconda environment 
for each such project. The shell script `setupDevEnv.sh` is meant for installing everything 
necessary for a project (in case I am not making any `environment.yml` file).

```sh
#!/bin/bash

PROJECT_NAME="omegaconf"
PROJECT_CONDA_ENV=$PROJECT_NAME"_env"

# PROJECT_CONDA_ENV = omegaconf_env
conda create -n $PROJECT_CONDA_ENV python=3.8 -qy
conda activate $PROJECT_CONDA_ENV
# My preferred packages
conda install jupyter jupyterlab -y
# For formatting, testing and coverage support
conda install -c conda-forge autopep8 pytest pytest-cov coverage -y
# For making custom cli using typer
conda install -c conda-forge typer tqdm typer-cli -y
# For linting support in .rst files
conda install rstcheck -c conda-forge -y
# Project specific packages
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt -e .
pre-commit install
```

To setup the environment, run: `. ./.vscode/setupDevEnv.sh` from the project root directory.

> *I prefer to keep these personal setup/helper files under the `.vscode` folder, as that makes 
sure these files will not be accidentally pushed to the repository. These files are meant for 
only my use (albeit there is no personal/sensitive information in them).*

## Using `setconda` command for quick startup

I prefer to startup the VS Code terminals quickly with a command `setconda`, which 
essentially runs `conda activate <environment-name>` for that project.

For `omegaconf` project, I have it setup as follows. The important part is to place 
this file under `.vscode` forlder: `omegaconf/.vscode/setconda.sh`. And then add the 
following command to `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
# For setconda command
alias setconda=". ./.vscode/setconda.sh"
# For xmake command
alias xmake="make -f ./.vscode/Makefile"
```

Here is the content of `omegaconf/.vscode/setconda.sh`, as an example:

> *Note: **option-2** is more modular*

### Option-1

```sh
#!/bin/bash

### Info on conda environment
# CREATED AS: conda create -n omegaconf_env python=3.8

# To run this script from project root directory:
# RUN: . .vscode/setconda.sh

alias setconda='. ./.vscode/setconda.sh'
#alias xmake="make -C ./.vscode"
alias xmake="make -f ./.vscode/Makefile"

PROJECT_NAME="omegaconf"
PROJECT_CONDA_ENV="omegaconf_env"

BOLD=$(tput bold)
NORMAL=$(tput sgr0)
COLOR_RED=$(tput setaf 1)
COLOR_GREEN=$(tput setaf 2)
COLOR_YELLOW=$(tput setaf 3)

ENVNAME=$(echo -e "${COLOR_RED}${BOLD}${PROJECT_CONDA_ENV}${NORMAL}")
PROJECT=$(echo -e "${COLOR_GREEN}${BOLD}${PROJECT_NAME}${NORMAL}")

echo -e "\n⚙️ Activating conda environment... ⏳\n \n\t 🔥 ${BOLD} EnvName ${NORMAL}: ${ENVNAME} \n\t ✨ ${BOLD} Project ${NORMAL}: ${PROJECT} \n"

```

### Option-2: *PREFERRED* 🔥 ⭐

Here we breakdown the code into two files.

**1. File: `.vscode/setconda.sh`**

```sh
#!/bin/bash

### File: Setconda.sh

# To run this script from project root directory:
# RUN: . .vscode/setconda.sh

alias setconda='. ./.vscode/setconda.sh'
#alias xmake="make -C ./.vscode"
alias xmake="make -f ./.vscode/Makefile"

PROJECT_NAME="omegaconf"
PROJECT_CONDA_ENV="omegaconf_env"

formatsetconda $PROJECT_NAME $PROJECT_CONDA_ENV

unset \
    PROJECT_NAME \
    PROJECT_CONDA_ENV

```

**2. File: `~/.user-defined/user-defined.sh`**:

We add the following code block to the file: `~/.user-defined/user-defined.sh`

This will introduce a function `condaEnvActivate` and a rather self-explanatory *alias*
`formatsetconda` to the shell. In order to load this user-defined command everytime, I prefer 
adding the line, `. $HOME/".user-defined/user-defined.sh"` to `~/.bashrc` file.

```sh
# Function to format setconda output
function condaEnvActivate(){
    # This requires two input arguments. Example:
    # condaEnvActivate $PROJECT_NAME $PROJECT_CONDA_ENV
    PROJECT_NAME=$1
    PROJECT_CONDA_ENV=$2
    BOLD=$(tput bold)
    NORMAL=$(tput sgr0)
    COLOR_RED=$(tput setaf 1)
    COLOR_GREEN=$(tput setaf 2)
    COLOR_YELLOW=$(tput setaf 3)

    ENVNAME=$(echo -e "${COLOR_RED}${BOLD}${PROJECT_CONDA_ENV}${NORMAL}")
    PROJECT=$(echo -e "${COLOR_GREEN}${BOLD}${PROJECT_NAME}${NORMAL}")

    echo -e "\n⚙️ Activating conda environment... ⏳\n \n\t 🔥 ${BOLD} EnvName ${NORMAL}: ${ENVNAME} \n\t ✨ ${BOLD} Project ${NORMAL}: ${PROJECT} \n"
    conda activate $PROJECT_CONDA_ENV

    unset \
    	PROJECT_NAME \
	PROJECT_CONDA_ENV \
        ENVNAME \
        PROJECT \
        BOLD \
        NORMAL \
        COLOR_RED \
        COLOR_GREEN \
        COLOR_YELLOW
