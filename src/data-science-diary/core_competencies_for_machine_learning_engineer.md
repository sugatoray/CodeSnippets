Machine Learning Scientists work in the research and development of algorithms that are used in adaptive systems. For example, they build methods for predicting product suggestions (recommendations) and product demand (forecasting), and explore Big Data to automatically extract patterns (large-scale machine learning and pattern recognition). Some Machine Learning positions include Machine Learning Scientist, Research Science Manager, and Data Sciences Lead.
